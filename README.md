Web platform that provides seamless integration of inventory processes within the biological testing workflow.

Dedicated team of 2 Ruby developers and 1 QA specialist, client’s team extension

Technologies: Ruby, Ruby on Rails

Industry: Healthcare

# Challenge
The client is a UK-based supplier of knowledge-based healthcare solutions aimed to improve the data management process of laboratories and medical research centers. Their flagship product – BioRails – needed functionality enhancement and significant customization.

The client lacked Ruby capacity to meet the deadline. They also had a fixed budget, and there was a constant risk of overrunning it because of a high turnover. We provided 2 developers and a QA specialist on a dedicated basis for a long term to implement the inventory module of BioRails product.

# Our solution
Our developers joined the client’s core team taking on the tasks that the Project Manager based in the UK assigned to them. Right off the bat, we set effective communication within the team. Our developers quickly gained a deep understanding of the product.

The development was split into 2-week sprints. Each sprint resulted in a working demo version of the module. The client was able to adjust the scope of work on the go without breaking the deadline.

The functionality we worked on included:

inventory management and availability check
item registration and transfer
define and use of custom container layouts
integration with other client’s software products
version upgrade
custom functionality improvement

# Outcome
Our developers successfully led the module to the release stage and delivered it to the client. BioRails Inventory module was seamlessly integrated into BioRails core functionality and customized for the end clients.

Upon the project launch, the client scaled down the team to 1 developer for further support of the module.
